Buckets
- buckets are owned by and trust the account (root) they are created in, no one else
- Use IAM roles/policies to give bucket perms within same account
- CAN'T be used to give bucket perms to entities outside the account that you don't owned
- How then? Resource policy, or bucket policy
    - Used to authorize access to buckets or objects inside a bucket
    - Can apply to anonymous accesses (public)
    - Final authorization is a combination of all applicable policies
        - Priority order is 1. Explicit Deny, 2. Explicit Allow, 3. Implicit Deny
    - ACLs for granular, object-level permissions; AWS discourages use now
