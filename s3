S3

Buckets
- buckets are owned by and trust the account (root) they are created in, no one else
- Use IAM roles/policies to give bucket perms within same account
- CAN'T be used to give bucket perms to entities outside the account that you don't owned
- How then? Resource policy, or bucket policy
    - Used to authorize access to buckets or objects inside a bucket
    - Can apply to anonymous accesses (public)
    - Final authorization is a combination of all applicable policies
        - Priority order is 1. Explicit Deny, 2. Explicit Allow, 3. Implicit Deny
    - ACLs for granular, object-level permissions; AWS discourages use now

Uploads
- Single PUT Upload vs Multipart Upload
    - Single PUT: Limit of 5GB, can cause performance issues, if upload fails WHOLE UPLOAD fails
    - Multipart: Object is broken up (up to 10k parts), each part 5MB to 5GB, last part can be less
    - Multipart is faster (parallel), individual parts can fail and be retried, AWS recommends for
      anything > 100 MB, required for > 5GB

Encryption
- Data between S3 is encrypted in transit; Encryption at rest can be configured on a per-object basis
	- Client-side: when strict security compliance needed
	- Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys (SSE-C): S3 handles encrypt/decrypt, 	customer responsible for keys, must be supplied for PUT/GET
	- Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3): Objects encrypted using AES-256 by 		S3, S3 generates keys via KMS, keys stored with objects in encrypted form, if you have perms
	you can decrypt and access
	- Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS): Objects encrypted using 		individual keys KMS generates, encrypted keys stored w/ encrypted objects, decrypt needs S3 		and KMS key perms (role separation)
- Bucket Default Encryption:
	- Objects are encrypted in S3, not buckets.
	- Each PUT operation must specify encryption or not

S3 Encryption Options

Client-Side Encryption:
- Client responsible for encryption/decryption, key management
- Used when strict security compliance needed (admin + process overhead)

Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys (SSE-C)
- S3 handles encrypt/decrypt, customer responsible for key management
- Must be supplied for each PUT/GET

Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
- Objects encrypted by S3 using AES-256, S3 generates keys via KMS
- Encrypted keys stored with encrypted objects, decryption requires access perms

Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
- Objects encrypted using individual KMSgenerated keys, 
- Encrypted keys stored with encrypted objects, decryption requires S3 and KMS key perms (provides role separation)
